# JS_game_builder
3 retro game tutorials designed to help teach JavaScript fundamentals to beginners. Intended as a 5-day camp for beginners, with 4 hours of working each day. Hosted Live @ https://mikebrownie.github.io/code-ninjas/lab-instructions/

## The Problem
In March, coronavirus forced our coding bootcamp to close and left most of our planned camps impossible to run. I designed this website to help the students progress their JavaScript skills and emphasize coding fundamentals that make programs work.
